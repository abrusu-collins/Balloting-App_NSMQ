# Balloting-App_NSMQ

Over the years, NSMQ uses a  balloting process that is very long.
They write numbers on pieces of papers and the schools come to pick, so when three schools have the same number on their papers it means they are competing against each other.So all the schools will come one after another to pick and  this is a very lengthy process.  That is why I created this app to make this faster, simpler and very efficient.
